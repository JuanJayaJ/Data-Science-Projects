# Predict Crop Yield

In this project, it was established that machine learning can effectively "predict crop yields" based on historical climate and environmental data.

#Models Used
Several machine learning models were tested which includes:
1. Ensemble methods
2. Neural network
3. Standard regression

#Performance metrics
I also evaluated the performance based on metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared (R^2), and rooth mean square error (RMSE)
The Food Security Index was calculated as a critical metric to assess whether there will be a sufficient food supply to meet human consumption needs by 2030, aligning with the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals

#Best Model
Results found Neural Network to be the best performing out of all the models tested.  However, Bagged Decision Tree was ultimately selected as it has better interpretability and transparency. 

#Limitation
There are certain limitations to the model, which involves estimating future environmental predictors like rainfall and temperature. Currently it is done using a simple linear regression, but more sophisticated models will need to be explored for a more accurate prediction.

#Visualisation
Heat map and time lapse forecasts were generated and showed changing crop yields across different regions across time.  There were more drastic changes observed in Top 10 Developing Countries compared to Top 10 Developed Countries.

#Result
Results indicated that the goal is on track to being met, but not in all food classes. For example, there will be an abundance of potatoes but not rice. There could potentially be an opportunity for countries to assist each other, especially those with surplus. This will require a coordinated effort between all countries, and the United Nations will have an important role to play in this.
